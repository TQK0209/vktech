name = GRA4 Social Network
description = "Big social networks put plenty of web communities out of commission - anyone can create a group on Facebook, and it's much easier than to build and support whole website. We want to get web-masters back into the game - with GRA4 any Drupal installation can get it's own full-blown social networking subsystem."
